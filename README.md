# COVID-19 Vaccination Campaign Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 vaccination and case data to identify trends, data inconsistencies, and insights that can support public-health decision-making. The goal was to simulate how analysts validate and transform large datasets before building dashboards for stakeholders.

The workflow includes SQL-based data extraction and transformation, followed by dashboard visualization in Tableau.
